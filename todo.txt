Remaining move effects to implement for a comprehensive port of move effect mechanics:

Multi-turn/locking and specials
- Rollout/Ice Ball: ensure turn timers and reset behavior (we ramp power already)
- Fury Cutter: ensure counter reset on miss/switch (we ramp power already)
- Focus Punch: add user-facing fail message/flag path (logic exists)
- Uproar: verify global sleep prevention timing across turns (wake implemented)

Delayed/turn-timed
- Doom Desire: mirror Future Sight handling (uses same pipeline)

Field/item interactions
- Rapid Spin: free partial-trap and Leech Seed; remove Spikes from user’s side
- Brick Break: remove Reflect/Light Screen on hit (and apply after damage ordering)
- Knock Off: remove target’s item and mark in knockedOffMons
- Thief/Covet: steal target item if user has none; respect constraints
- Trick: swap items between user/target

Status/volatile specials
- Yawn: drowsy then sleep next turn; respect Uproar/Insomnia/etc.
- Will-O-Wisp: primary burn move
- Swagger/Flatter: confuse + raise target’s Atk/SpA by 2
- Mean Look: apply escape prevention to target
- Psych Up: copy target’s stat stages
- Baton Pass: pass stat stages and allowed volatiles (Substitute, etc.)
- Magic Coat: reflect reflectable status moves
- Snatch: steal self-targeting buffs this turn
- Foresight/Odor Sleuth: negate Ghost immunities and Evasion for user vs target
- Refresh: cure user’s major status
- Heal Bell/Aromatherapy: cure party statuses (respect Soundproof edge cases)
- Teeter Dance: confuse all adjacent foes (and partner in doubles)

Variable power/type
- Weather Ball: set type/power from weather
- Hidden Power: compute type/power from IVs
- Return/Frustration: power from friendship
- Low Kick: power from target weight
- Flail/Reversal: power from user HP ratio
- Eruption/Water Spout: power from user HP ratio
- Revenge: boosted power if user was hit first
- Present: random power or heal outcome
- Secret Power: terrain-dependent secondary effect
- Nature Power: call terrain-dependent move
- Assist/Metronome/Sketch/Role Play: meta-move behaviors

Redirection/party/other
- Follow Me: implement redirection via SideTimer.followme
- Helping Hand: 1.5x partner’s damage this turn
- Camouflage: change user’s type based on terrain (define mapping)
- Memento: user faints; target’s Atk/SpA -2 stages
- SmellingSalt: boosted vs paralyzed and cures paralysis on hit
- Facade: boosted power while statused

Polish/verification
- Minimize interactions (double damage/contact flags for certain moves)
- Screen/Reflect math in doubles (1/3 vs 1/2 in singles) if we add doubles
- Exact per-move recoil/drain ratios where generic differs (Double-Edge, etc.)
